What are these?
These are mathematical / artistic representations of how I've experienced the product design process
over my 6 years of design projects and 3 years of working in a design studio.

It starts out messy and formless, with new ideas and possibilities exploding during 
the period of time where the team scopes out the problem. Once the frame forms, the design 
process starts going into iteration cycles, where the team breaks their product down, and through 
research builds it back up into cohesive insights - only to break it back down again, with each
mess and each insight building into a bigger picture.
